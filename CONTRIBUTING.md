# Contributing

Welcome! We're super excited that you are interested in contributing to Braid.

There are a lot of ways you can be involved - not just coding - and all are valuable.


## Say Hello

If you'd like to contribute, jump into the [Braid group on Braid](https://braid.chat/braid) and say hello. We can help match you with a good task, point you to resources and help you if you run into any problems.

@jamesnvc and @rafd have a standing offer to remotely pair with anyone on Braid. Send a message on Braid chat if you'd like to take us up on it.

We want to make contributing to Braid as painless as possible (and, ideally, gratifying). Please let us know how we can improve.


## Giving Feedback

We want Braid to be useful to you, so we highly value your feedback.

Right now, we're especially looking for feedback on:

  - the first-time user experience
  - the first-time contributor experience
  - the first-time developer experience

You can give us feedback [Braid](https://braid.chat/braid) or via [Github Issues](https://github.com/braidchat/braid/issues).
