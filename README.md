# Braid

Braid is an open-source group chat application for teams and communities designed to promote productive conversations.

It is written in clojure(script) and developed by the clojure community.

Here's what it looks like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa2bUsChFqM (early prototype)

Circumstances led us to open-source this sooner than we were planning, so there are a lot of rough edges. Please be patient.

In the short-term, we will be focusing on the ‘get-it-running-on-your-machine’ experience. In the meantime, you can try to decipher our development and setup notes here:

Conversations are current happening on the #braid-chat channel at clojurians.slack.com (until we start dogfooding, of course!)
