Other people have said it well:

"Be Less Busy" turns out to be a lie

---> chatrooms force you to be always on
       forced synchronicity
       small window of opportunity to be heard

       ---> fear of missing out

       ---> have to check frequently

            ---> continous partial attention
                 multitasking
                 context shifting
                 loss of focus

       ---> knee-jerk responses
            shallow conversations
            communicating one-line at a time

       ---> expectation of synchronicity

            ---> ASAP culture
                   everything is now

            ---> interruption culture

                 ---> loss of focus


  --->
    conversations


ooh, squirrel! / ADD topic switching
 - devolving conversation


---> difficult finding past conversations
        giant stream of interwoven chatter


---> low quality conversation

     ----> lowest-common-denominator chatter
              ie. cat gifs


implied consensus
  it was talked about, therefore, agreed

"never-ending watercooler"


chat-rooms are like an open-office, but where you can hear *everyone* at *all* times

braid, is more like private offices, and a time-travel machine for conversations



more messages
mental fatigue - "following group chat all day feels like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda"
"chatter"
a lot of noise, not a lot of signal


information flow, on your time


repetition / rehashing


we're a remote, distribute team that self-allocates time; information flow is importa



Problems:
 - an ASAP culture
 - implied consensus
 - shallow conversations
 - lack of context

 - forced attention
 - an interruption culture
 - context shifting

 - difficulting finding past


 -

Chat rooms aren't a great model for how conversations really work.


firehose is bad


## The Root of the Problem

SYNCHRONICITY vs ASYNCHRONICITY

SINGLE-THREAD vs MULTI-THREAD

Each room is a single stream of the collective consciousness of the participants, with seemingly little [attentional control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_control).
