## Why yet-another-chat-app?

See [Motivation](https://github.com/braidchat/meta/wiki/Motivation)

First prototype was a one-day hack but we loved it; shared it with some folks, they loved it; so here we are

...different folks have different reasons for supporting Braid, ex. couldn't find an existing app that:

 - was hackable / open-source
 - promoted better conversations
 - was written in clojure(script)
 - ...

(or a combination of some or all of the above)

## Why not build on top of xmpp / irc / matrix / etc.?

Maybe we will.

For now, we're focusing on improving the front-end experience, so the backend we already wrote is good enough.

## Why clojure + clojurescript? Why not...

We know and enjoy clojure(script), so far it's been good enough.
