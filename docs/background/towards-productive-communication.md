# Towards Productive Communication

   - target audience: teams and online communities
   - allow for both real-time and async experiences
       (ie. don't demand the group's full attention just to keep the conversation on track)

Forums address some of these issues (but even threads still often have the tangent problem)... need to make threading easier, but this needs balance too (full threading results in fractal conversation, can also be difficult to follow)

Braid's major changes are:
 - thinking with tags instead of rooms (similar to how Gmail thinks with tags vs folders);
 - per-topic conversations, instead of per-room chatter (similar to how you have Facebook comments on each post)

As a result...

  - you can have multiple simultaneous conversations related to a tag (vs. trying to keep track of multiple conversations in one room)

  - users can "mute" conversations (vs. having to deal with notifications for irrelevant messages in a room you want to stay in)

  - conversations can be resumed without context loss (vs. having to search for old messages)

  - no active conversations = your screen is empty (vs. old messages showing)

  - conversations can have multiple tags (vs. settling on the 'best' room)

  - conversations can change tags over time (vs. maintaining a conversation in an inappropriate room)
