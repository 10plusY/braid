# Contributing

Welcome! We're super excited that you are interested in contributing to Braid.

There are a lot of ways you can be involved - not just coding - and all are valuable:


## Say Hello

If you'd like to contribute, jump into the [Braid group on Braid](http://braid.chat/group/braid) and say hello. We can help match you with a good task, point you to resources and help you if you run into any problems.

@jamesnvc and @rafd have a standing offer to remotely pair with anyone on Braid (via [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) or [Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/)). Send a message on Braid chat if you'd like to take us up on it.

We want to make contributing to Braid as painless as possible (and, ideally, gratifying). Please let us know how we can improve.


## Giving Feedback

We want Braid to be useful to you, so we highly value your feedback.

Right now, we're especially looking for feedback on:

  - the first-time user experience
  - the first-time contributor experience
  - the first-time developer experience

You can give us feedback [Braid](http://braid.chat/group/braid) or via [Github Issues](https://github.com/braidchat/meta/issues).


### Reporting Issues

Found a bug or some other issue? Let us know on [Braid](http://braid.chat/group/braid) or create an issue on [Braid Meta](https://github.com/braidchat/meta/issues).

Try to take a moment to confirm it's a new issue for searching for it in [Braid Meta](https://github.com/braidchat/meta/issues).

If it's a security issue, please do not post it publicly, and instead, report it to us via email (see our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](./responsible-disclosure-policy.md).


### Contributing Feature Ideas

If you have an idea for a new feature or change to Braid, we'd love to hear it. Let us know on [Braid](http://braid.chat/group/braid) or create an issue on [Braid Meta](https://github.com/braidchat/meta/issues).


### Feedback and Voting on Planned Features

There are a lot of ideas on [Braid Meta](https://github.com/braidchat/meta/issues), and your feedback can help us prioritize which ones to address. Give the existing ideas a look, and feel free to leave a comment or a :+1:.


### Triaging and Organizing Issues

[Braid Meta](https://github.com/braidchat/meta/issues) needs help staying organized (tagging issues, removing duplicates, removing stales issues, etc.) and if that sounds interesting to you, let us know.

### Adressing "Help Wanted" Issues

We've been tagging issues that are ideal for first-time committers with the [#help-wanted tag on Braid Meta](https://github.com/braidchat/meta/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted). Most of these i can be addressed with minor code changes that don't require knowledge of the full system.
