# Communication Infrastructure Should be Open

(in progress)

For many years, group chat on the internet was dominated by IRC, mailing lists, forums and XMPP.

Presently, Slack is the king of group chat, eclipsing the previous technologies.


## Benefits of Open Source

- not under risk of patron removing your rights

    (ex. Reactiflux community hitting Slack user limit and moving to Discord)

- freedom to extend: anyone can add features

- self-hosting, security, privacy

- standards, interoperability
