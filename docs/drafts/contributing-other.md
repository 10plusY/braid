### Adressing "Help Wanted" Issues

We've been tagging issues that are ideal for first-time committers with the [`help wanted`](https://github.com/braidchat/braid/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) tag on Braid Meta. Most of these issues can be addressed with minor code changes that don't require knowledge of the full system.
