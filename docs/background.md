## Background

## Genesis (July 2015 -)

Braid started out as a weekend hack to explore the idea of using tags and short conversations to address the shortcomings found with Slack/HipChat/IRC-like chat clients (see [Motivation](./motivation.md)). Here's a [video of an early proof-of-concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa2bUsChFqM). It was literally coded in a hammock.

The new approach proved valueable. @jamesnvc and @rafd replaced Slack with Braid at their work and started using it daily. Occasionally, they would add new features, but kept the project to themselves.


## Catalysis (January 2016 -)

In early 2016, discussions started on the #clojurians Slack community regarding migrating away from Slack due to concerns about Slack not wanting to support large free communities (a few months earlier, the Reactiflux community had to abandon Slack because they hit Slack's user limits). A recurring suggestion was for the community to develop their own clojure(script)-based alternative.

@jamesnvc and @rafd offered to open-source their client and to lead a community effort around developing it. Thus the code was open-sourced and Braid was officially born.

However, things were a bit rough: No docs. The UX needed a lot of polish. The 'get-it-working-locally' experience was horrible. Code needed cleaning. Basic features were missing. And so on...


## Present Day (Sep 2016)

Since then, with rekindled interest and the help of new contributors, much progress has been made.

Braid has many teams using it and new ones joining frequently.
