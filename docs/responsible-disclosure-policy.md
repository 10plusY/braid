# Responsible Disclosure Policy

Safety and data security is very important to the Braid community. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our code base, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner:

  1. Please email security@braidchat.com to report any security vulnerabilities found in the [open source code maintained by Braid](https://github.com/braidchat/).
  2. Please refrain from requesting compensation for reporting vulnerabilities.
  3. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and send you regular updates about our progress.
  4. If your report results in a change to the code base or documentation of a Braid product, we will – at your option – publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure.


Please do not test directly against our production instances. You can [install a copy of Braid yourself](./dev/getting-up-and-running-in-development.md) to test against.

If you want to encrypt your disclosure email please email us to ask for our PGP key.
